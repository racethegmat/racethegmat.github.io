  Safe, customer-facing template language for flexible web apps
---

Liquid is an open-source template language created by Shopify and written in
Ruby. It is the backbone of Shopify themes and is used to load dynamic content
on storefronts.

Liquid has been in production use at Shopify since 2006 and is now used by many
other hosted web applications.
