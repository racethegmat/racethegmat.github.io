GitHub Pages is a static site hosting service designed to host your personal,
organization, or project pages directly from a GitHub repository.

You can create and publish GitHub Pages sites online using the Jekyll Theme
Chooser. Or if you prefer to work locally, you can use GitHub Desktop or the
command line.

GitHub Pages is a static site hosting service and doesn't support server-side
code such as, PHP, Ruby, or Python.

To learn more about the different types of GitHub Pages sites, see "User,
organization, and project pages."
